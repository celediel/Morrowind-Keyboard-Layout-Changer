# Morrowind-Keyboard-Layout-Changer

## What it does ##

MWSE Lua mod to allow non-Qwerty keyboard layouts in vanilla engine Morrowind.

**Currently supported:**

* Dvorak
* Colemak
* Workman (US and UK varieties)

## Known Issues ##

Layouts that use letters outside the standard and extended ASCII tables will remain unsupported, due to the way Morrowind translate key presses to text.

i.e. Turkish FGĞIOD, Latvian ĄŽERTY

## Requirements ##
MWSE 2.1 nightly @ [github](https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE)

## Credits ##
* MWSE Team for MWSE with Lua support
* NullCascade for the initial code snippets I built this mod upon
